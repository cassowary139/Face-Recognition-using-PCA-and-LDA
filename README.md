# Face-Recognition-using-PCA-and-LDA

This repository includes implementation of Face Recognition techniques using prominent linear transformation techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).


This project uses the [AT&T "The Database of Faces" (formerly "The ORL Database of Faces")](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html). As far as results and comparison of the two algorithms is concerned, an accuracy of 95% using PCA and 78.125% using LDA was obtained.
